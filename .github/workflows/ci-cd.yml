# The "on" option will specify when to run this action 
  # and on which branch. 
# Usually for a CI action you would like to run 
  # it on every pull request and on push.
# For CD, you would probably only want to run it on 
  # closed pull requests or direct pushes on master.
# If you want to run it manually you would add "worflow_dispatch".

# Jobs are run separately and will spin up a 
  # new build machine for each sub-item

  # This is just a custom name "build" but it can be anything
