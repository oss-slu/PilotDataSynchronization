# pilot training data synchronization

Our project is still in progress, and the current phase focuses on data extraction and communication protocols. As the project evolves, additional features and optimizations will be implemented.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to extract key data from the X-Plane flight simulator, including Altitude, Airspeed, Vertical Airspeed, Heading attributes, and transmit it to the iMotions platform via a TCP client connection. The extracted data will be formatted according to iMotionsâ€™ API requirements, enabling real-time data synchronization for advanced analysis of pilot performance.

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

To run the code, ensure you have the following installed:

C++ Compiler: The project is written in C++.
Winsock2 Library: Required for socket programming on Windows.
X-Plane Plugin SDK: For accessing flight data from X-Plane.
iMotions API Documentation: To correctly format and transmit data to the platform.

## Contributing
