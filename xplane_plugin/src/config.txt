//I want to make a config file so that the user can use their own ip later or maybe find a better way of doing it 
//my main idea is that when the user pulls up xplane on the plugin I think there should be something that shows where the 
data is being sent like how I to join a port in the terminal to see the data. I think there should be a port labled on it 
so that incase we need it we can connect to that port on a different computer. 
IP=192.168.0.42
PORT=49005
